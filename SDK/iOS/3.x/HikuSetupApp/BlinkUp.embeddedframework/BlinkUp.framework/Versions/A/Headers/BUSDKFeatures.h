 *  @brief Enabled extra feature SDK wide
 *
 *  If you require extra features when using the SDK, you can enable them here
 *  with the feature codes provided by Electric Imp. The feature codes are
 *  specific to your ApiKey. During initial configuration, it is good practice
 *  to examine the return list to ensure all the features you will change are
 *  enabled. If this method is called multiple times, each successive call will
 *  overwrite any previously enabled features.
 *
 *  To clear all features, pass in an empty featureCodes array.
 *
 *  @param apiKey       The APIKey assigned to you from Electric Imp
 *  @param featureCodes All of the features codes that should be enabled
 *
 *  @return The list of feature names that were enabled

 *  to provide an extra layer of security. If the value is nil, the anchor
 *  certificate will not be checked.

 *  additional layer of security to the API calls. If the privateCloudHost is
 *  nil, the default server will be used. If the anchorCertCN is nil, any
 *  certificate trusted by the system will be valid.
